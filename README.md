## Laravels Artisan "make" command upgrade

### Introduction

I have made this command as a helper command for Laravels Artisan `make` command. The idea behind it was that if you follow laravel
naming convention that you don't need to specify what exactly are you making.

So for example if you type `artisan make MyNewController`, the app will automatically assume that you're making a controller, thus you
are able to omit `:controller` from `make` command.

App is in beginning stages of development.
